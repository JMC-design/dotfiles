2013-01-08 23:59:06	onexused	fergal32, I know what you mean (about Linux gaming, rather than Arch specifically).  I've taken to only buying things that are gold or platinum supported with wine, or are specifically for Linux.

2013-01-09 00:02:04	fergal32	maybe it's because of arch64 which is causing problems. cant get rid of missing 32bit libs which i have installed. anyway. i can live without playing a game under linux. arch is too good hehehehehheheh

2013-01-11 13:38:58	Artel	I would just recursively change the permissions of /mnt/storage so others can read/execute, but I'm scared to do that since it's another partition and I don't want to mess up the files in windows
